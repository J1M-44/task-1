    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p> I have many hobbies that include rugby, riding and repairing stuff. I have played rugby since I was five and I started riding motorbikes when I was 3 to 4 years when I started riding a motorbike. I have been repairing stuff for a long time and cannot remember when I started. These are all activities I frequently take part in. </p>

    <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
    <p> I have favourite books that include THG, TMR and Powerless. I love these books as they're easy to relate to and can be entertaining, thrilling. I love THG because of the main character and thrill, TMR because of the thrill and are relatable. Powerless is thrilling and provides backstory and personal life. I love reading and connecting and imagining myself there with the characters. </p>

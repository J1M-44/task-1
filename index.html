  <p>This is a website I made to let others get to know me.</p>

  <section id="about" class="myBox">
    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <section id="hobbies" class="myBox">
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have many hobbies that include rugby, riding, and repairing stuff. I’ve played rugby since I was five and started riding motorbikes around age 3 or 4. I’ve been repairing things for a long time and don’t remember when I started.</p>

  <section id="books" class="myBox">
    <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
    <p>My favourite books include *The Hunger Games*, *The Maze Runner*, and *Powerless*. I enjoy them because they’re exciting and easy to connect with. I love reading and imagining myself in the story with the characters.</p>
